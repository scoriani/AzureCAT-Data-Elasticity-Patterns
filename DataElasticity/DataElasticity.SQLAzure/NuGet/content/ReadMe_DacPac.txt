This DacPac file builds the Configuration tables for the SQL Settings and Configuration implementation.

This Dacpac can be used to build the database directly, or be referenced in a larger database
as desired.  All tables in this DacPac are in the DataElasticity schema.

For projects that only require the supporting DLLs, the DacPac folder can be deleted.
